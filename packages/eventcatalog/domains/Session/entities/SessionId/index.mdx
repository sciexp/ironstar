## Overview

SessionId is a value object representing a unique identifier for an authenticated user session.
Each session created after OAuth callback receives a unique SessionId that persists until the session expires or is invalidated.

## Invariants

- Generated at boundary layer during session creation (not in pure domain logic)
- Immutable after creation
- Uniqueness guaranteed by generation algorithm (UUID or similar)

## Usage

- **Session aggregate**: Primary identifier for session lifecycle tracking
- **SessionCreated event**: Records the assigned SessionId
- **RefreshSession command**: References SessionId for authorization
- **InvalidateSession command**: References SessionId for logout
- **Zenoh key expressions**: Used in event routing (`events/session/{session_id}/...`)
