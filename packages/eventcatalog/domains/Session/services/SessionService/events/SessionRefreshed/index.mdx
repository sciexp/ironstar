## Description

This event is emitted when an active session's time-to-live is extended due to detected user activity.
Sessions are refreshed on meaningful interactions to prevent premature expiration during active use.

## When emitted

Given an active session exists for a user,
when the user performs an action that triggers TTL refresh (configurable activity threshold),
then a SessionRefreshed event is emitted with the new expiration timestamp.

## Downstream effects

- Session projection updated with new expiresAt
- Activity metrics updated for session analytics
