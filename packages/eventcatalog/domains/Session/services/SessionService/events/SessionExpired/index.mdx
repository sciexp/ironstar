## Description

This event is emitted when a session's time-to-live has elapsed without being refreshed.
A background process or lazy evaluation detects expired sessions and emits this event.

## When emitted

Given an active session exists with a defined expiresAt timestamp,
when the current time exceeds expiresAt and no refresh has occurred,
then a SessionExpired event is emitted and the session transitions to the Expired state.

## Downstream effects

- Session projection marks session as expired
- Session can no longer be used for authentication
- User must re-authenticate via OAuth to obtain a new session
