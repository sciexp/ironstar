id: SessionCreated
name: Session Created
version: 0.0.1
summary: |
  Emitted when a new authenticated session is created following successful OAuth callback.
producers:
  - SessionService
---

## Description

This event is emitted when an OAuth callback is successfully processed and a new user session is established.
The event captures the session identifier, associated user, OAuth provider, initial TTL expiration timestamp, and request metadata for security audit purposes.

## Session metadata

The metadata field captures request context at session creation time, enabling security audit capabilities:
- IP address and User-Agent for login history review
- Geolocation (populated at the boundary layer) for anomaly detection
- Comparison with SessionRefreshed metadata to detect location changes during a session

## When emitted

Given a user completes OAuth authentication with a supported provider (GitHub, Google),
when the SessionService processes the callback and validates the authorization code,
then a SessionCreated event is emitted with the new session details.

## Downstream effects

- Session projection updated with new active session
- User activity timestamp initialized
- Session cookie issued to client
