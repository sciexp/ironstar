## Description

This event is emitted when a user explicitly requests to log out.
The session is immediately invalidated and cannot be reused, even if the original TTL has not elapsed.

## When emitted

Given an active session exists for a user,
when the user initiates a logout action,
then a SessionInvalidated event is emitted and the session transitions to the Invalidated state.

## Downstream effects

- Session projection marks session as invalidated
- Session cookie cleared from client
- Any cached session data invalidated
