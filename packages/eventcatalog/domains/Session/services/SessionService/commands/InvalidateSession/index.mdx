summary: |
  Command to explicitly invalidate a session when a user logs out.
---

## Description

This command invalidates an active session, typically triggered by a user logout action.
Once invalidated, the session cannot be reused even if the original TTL has not elapsed.

## Preconditions

- Session exists and is in Active state
- Request originates from the session owner or an authorized admin

## Command handler behavior

The Decider's `decide` function validates:
1. Session ID exists in current state
2. Session is Active (already expired/invalidated sessions are no-ops)
3. Requester is authorized to invalidate the session

If validation passes, emits SessionInvalidated event.
Invalidating an already-terminated session is idempotent (no error, no event).
