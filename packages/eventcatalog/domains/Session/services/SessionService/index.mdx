## Responsibilities

- Process OAuth callbacks from GitHub (and future Google)
- Create, refresh, and invalidate user sessions
- Enforce session TTL expiration
- Emit session events for downstream consumers

## Aggregate: Session

The Session aggregate follows the Decider pattern from fmodel-rust:

- **decide(command, state) -> events**: Pure function validating commands against current state
- **evolve(state, event) -> state**: Pure function applying events to produce new state

### State Machine

```
NoSession -> Active -> (Expired | Invalidated)
```

- `NoSession`: Initial state, no authenticated user
- `Active(sessionId, userId, expiresAt)`: Authenticated session with TTL
- `Expired(sessionId)`: Session TTL elapsed
- `Invalidated(sessionId)`: Explicit logout
