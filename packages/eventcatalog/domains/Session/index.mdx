## Overview

The Session bounded context handles authentication through OAuth providers (GitHub primary, Google planned).
Sessions follow a strict lifecycle: create -> active -> expired/invalidated.

## Strategic Classification

**Supporting Domain**: Enables core business capabilities by providing secure authentication infrastructure.

## Key Aggregates

- **Session**: Manages session lifecycle with TTL-based expiration

## Shared Kernel Exports

- `UserId`: User identity combining OAuth provider and external ID (consumed by Workspace)
- `SessionId`: Reference type for session identification
