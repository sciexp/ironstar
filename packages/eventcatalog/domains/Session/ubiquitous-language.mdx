dictionary:
  - id: session
    name: Session
    summary: Authenticated user session with TTL-based lifecycle management
    description: |
      The aggregate root managing authenticated user sessions from creation through expiration or invalidation.
      Sessions follow a strict state machine: NoSession -> Active -> Expired/Invalidated.
    icon: Key

  - id: user
    name: User
    summary: OAuth-authenticated identity exported via Shared Kernel pattern
    description: |
      Represents an authenticated identity obtained from OAuth providers.
      Identity is the composite key (provider, externalId) which is immutable and stable across sessions.
      User is not an aggregate root; it is a reference type exported for consumption by other bounded contexts.

  - id: oauth-provider
    name: OAuth Provider
    summary: External authentication service (GitHub primary, Google planned)
    description: |
      The external identity provider that authenticates users.
      GitHub is the primary provider; Google is planned as a future extension.
      Each provider maps its claims to User entity fields differently.

  - id: composite-key
    name: Composite Key
    summary: User identity as (provider, externalId) tuple for stable references
    description: |
      The combination of OAuth provider and external ID that uniquely identifies a user.
      This algebraic representation (OAuthProvider x String) preserves event immutability
      and eliminates surrogate UUID indirection that can become stale.
    icon: Fingerprint

  - id: external-id
    name: External ID
    summary: Provider-assigned unique identifier stable across sessions
    description: |
      The immutable identifier assigned by the OAuth provider (e.g., GitHub numeric id, Google sub claim).
      Not a display name or email; this is the provider's internal stable reference.
    icon: Hash

  - id: session-id
    name: Session ID
    summary: Opaque identifier for session lifecycle tracking
    description: |
      A value object representing a unique identifier for an authenticated user session.
      Generated at the boundary layer during session creation and used for refresh and invalidation commands.
    icon: Tag

  - id: session-token
    name: Session Token
    summary: Bearer credential for authenticating HTTP requests
    description: |
      The token stored client-side (typically in a cookie) that references an active session.
      Validated against the session store on each request to establish user context.
    icon: Ticket

  - id: session-created
    name: Session Created
    summary: Event recording successful OAuth callback and session establishment
    description: |
      Emitted when a new session is established after OAuth callback processing.
      Contains SessionId, UserId, OAuthProvider, timestamp, and expiration time.
    icon: LogIn

  - id: session-expired
    name: Session Expired
    summary: Event recording automatic TTL-based session termination
    description: |
      Generated by the boundary layer when session TTL elapses.
      Transitions session state from Active to Expired; session cannot be refreshed afterward.
    icon: Clock

  - id: session-invalidated
    name: Session Invalidated
    summary: Event recording explicit user logout
    description: |
      Emitted when a user explicitly logs out, terminating their active session.
      Transitions session state from Active to Invalidated.
    icon: LogOut

  - id: active-session-view
    name: Active Session View
    summary: Read model projection for authentication checks
    description: |
      A disposable projection optimized for quick session lookup by SessionId.
      Rebuilt from the event stream following Hoffman's Law 3 (all projection data from events).
    icon: Eye

  - id: shared-kernel
    name: Shared Kernel
    summary: Pattern for exporting User identity to other bounded contexts
    description: |
      The DDD pattern used to share UserId and UserProfile types with Workspace and Analytics contexts.
      Other bounded contexts receive user references through session context rather than managing User entities directly.
    icon: Share2

## Session Domain Ubiquitous Language

This dictionary defines the authoritative terminology for the Session bounded context.
All team members, documentation, and code should use these terms consistently.

The Session domain is classified as a Supporting domain that enables core business capabilities by providing secure authentication infrastructure.
It exports user identity to other bounded contexts via the Shared Kernel pattern.
