  - id: shared-kernel
    name: Shared Kernel
    summary: Domain-agnostic types shared across all bounded contexts.
    description: |
      A DDD pattern where multiple bounded contexts agree to share a subset of domain model types.
      In ironstar, the Core domain provides value objects (Timestamp, Duration) that establish common vocabulary and invariants across Analytics, Workspace, and Session contexts.

  - id: timestamp
    name: Timestamp
    summary: Unix timestamp in milliseconds representing an instant in time.
    description: |
      Value object for temporal ordering in event sourcing.
      Used for both event time (when domain events occurred) and recorded time (when events were persisted).
      Total ordering ensures monotonic SSE delivery via Last-Event-ID semantics.

  - id: duration
    name: Duration
    summary: Elapsed time in milliseconds between two points in time.
    description: |
      Value object representing time spans.
      Used for query execution tracking, cache TTL configuration, and performance metrics in analytics projections.

  - id: value-object
    name: Value Object
    summary: Immutable type defined by attributes rather than identity.
    description: |
      A DDD tactical pattern for types that have no unique identity and are compared by their attribute values.
      All Core types (Timestamp, Duration) are value objects, ensuring immutability and deterministic behavior in projections.

  - id: cross-cutting-concern
    name: Cross-cutting Concern
    summary: Functionality that spans multiple bounded contexts.
    description: |
      Aspects like temporal ordering, serialization formats, and event envelope metadata that apply uniformly across all domains.
      The Core domain encapsulates these concerns as reusable value objects.

  - id: event-envelope
    name: Event Envelope
    summary: Metadata wrapper containing timestamps and routing information for events.
    description: |
      Standard structure surrounding domain events with event time, recorded time, aggregate identifiers, and sequence numbers.
      Enables temporal queries, point-in-time projections, and SSE replay semantics.
