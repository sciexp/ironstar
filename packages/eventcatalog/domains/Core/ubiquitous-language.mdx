  - id: shared-kernel
    name: Shared Kernel
    summary: Domain-agnostic types shared across all bounded contexts.
    description: |
      A DDD pattern where multiple bounded contexts agree to share a subset of domain model types.
      In ironstar, the Core domain provides value objects (Timestamp, Duration) that establish common vocabulary and invariants across Analytics, Workspace, and Session contexts.

  - id: timestamp
    name: Timestamp
    summary: Unix timestamp in milliseconds representing an instant in time.
    description: |
      Value object for temporal ordering in event sourcing.
      Used for both event time (when domain events occurred) and recorded time (when events were persisted).
      Total ordering ensures monotonic SSE delivery via Last-Event-ID semantics.
    icon: Clock

  - id: duration
    name: Duration
    summary: Elapsed time in milliseconds between two points in time.
    description: |
      Value object representing time spans.
      Used for query execution tracking, cache TTL configuration, and performance metrics in analytics projections.
    icon: Timer

  - id: value-object
    name: Value Object
    summary: Immutable type defined by attributes rather than identity.
    description: |
      A DDD tactical pattern for types that have no unique identity and are compared by their attribute values.
      All Core types (Timestamp, Duration) are value objects, ensuring immutability and deterministic behavior in projections.
    icon: Box

  - id: cross-cutting-concern
    name: Cross-cutting Concern
    summary: Functionality that spans multiple bounded contexts.
    description: |
      Aspects like temporal ordering, serialization formats, and event envelope metadata that apply uniformly across all domains.
      The Core domain encapsulates these concerns as reusable value objects.
    icon: Layers

  - id: event-envelope
    name: Event Envelope
    summary: Metadata wrapper containing timestamps and routing information for events.
    description: |
      Standard structure surrounding domain events with event time, recorded time, aggregate identifiers, and sequence numbers.
      Enables temporal queries, point-in-time projections, and SSE replay semantics.

  - id: sum-type
    name: Sum Type
    summary: Algebraic data type representing one of several mutually exclusive variants.
    description: |
      Tagged union where a value is exactly one variant at a time (e.g., QueryState = Idle | Running | Completed | Failed).
      Makes illegal states unrepresentable by construction.
      In Rust, implemented as enums with pattern matching for exhaustive handling.
    icon: GitBranch

  - id: product-type
    name: Product Type
    summary: Algebraic data type combining multiple fields into a single composite value.
    description: |
      Record or tuple where all fields are present simultaneously (e.g., GridPosition = { row, col }).
      The cardinality is the product of constituent type cardinalities.
      In Rust, implemented as structs.
    icon: Combine

  - id: decider
    name: Decider
    summary: Pure function triple (decide, evolve, initial_state) for aggregate behavior.
    description: |
      The fmodel-rust pattern encoding aggregate logic as pure functions.
      decide: (State, Command) -> Vec<Event> validates commands and emits events.
      evolve: (State, Event) -> State applies events to produce new state.
      initial_state: () -> State provides the starting aggregate state.

  - id: signal
    name: Signal
    summary: Time-varying value in functional reactive programming.
    description: |
      Datastar signals represent reactive state that propagates changes automatically.
      Server pushes signal updates via SSE; browser reactivity handles DOM updates.
      Signals are the FRP primitive connecting event-sourced state to UI.
    icon: Radio

  - id: aggregate
    name: Aggregate
    summary: Consistency boundary grouping related entities and enforcing invariants.
    description: |
      DDD tactical pattern where the aggregate root controls all access to contained entities.
      All state changes occur through the root via command handling.
      In ironstar, aggregates are modeled as Deciders with sum-type state machines.
    icon: Package

  - id: projection
    name: Projection
    summary: Read model derived exclusively from the event stream.
    description: |
      CQRS pattern where query-optimized views are built by replaying events.
      Projections are disposable and can be rebuilt at any time (Hoffman's Law 5).
      Examples include ActiveSessionView, CatalogMetadataView, and analytics caches.
    icon: Monitor

  - id: event-sourcing
    name: Event Sourcing
    summary: Persistence pattern storing state changes as an immutable sequence of events.
    description: |
      Instead of storing current state, the system stores the complete history of domain events.
      Current state is reconstructed by replaying events through the evolve function.
      Enables temporal queries, audit trails, and event-driven projections.
