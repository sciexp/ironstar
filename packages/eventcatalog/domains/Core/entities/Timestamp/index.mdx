## Overview

Timestamp is a value object representing an instant in time as Unix milliseconds.
Ironstar uses Timestamp for two distinct purposes:

1. **Event Time**: When an event occurred in the domain (business time)
2. **Recorded Time**: When the event was stored in the event log (system time)

Both times are required in the EventEnvelope to support temporal queries, point-in-time projections, and SSE replay semantics.

## Invariants

- Non-negative values: All timestamps must be >= 0
- Total ordering: For any two timestamps, exactly one of t1 < t2, t1 == t2, or t1 > t2 holds
- Epoch reference: All values are measured in milliseconds since January 1, 1970 UTC

## Usage

- **EventEnvelope**: Contains two Timestamps (event time and recorded time)
- **Session aggregate**: Tracks session expiration via ExpiresAt (Timestamp alias)
- **QuerySession aggregate**: Records query start times
- **CatalogMetadata**: Tracks last refresh time
- **SSE resumption**: Timestamp ordering ensures monotonic event delivery via Last-Event-ID
