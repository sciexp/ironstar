## Overview

Duration is a value object representing the elapsed time between two instants.
Ironstar uses Duration to track query execution time and cache entry lifetimes.

## Invariants

- Non-negative values: All durations must be >= 0 (time cannot flow backward)
- Millisecond precision: Values represent elapsed milliseconds (1/1000th of a second)

## Usage

- **QuerySession aggregate**: Records execution duration in QueryCompleted events
- **moka cache**: TTL values specified as Duration for cache eviction policy
- **Analytics projections**: Tracks query performance metrics
