## Overview

QueryId is a value object representing a unique identifier for a query execution session within the Analytics bounded context.
Each query execution receives a unique identifier that tracks it through its lifecycle.

## Invariants

- Query ID must be unique across all query executions
- Query ID equality is determined by string equality
- Query ID is immutable once assigned

## Usage

- **QuerySession aggregate**: Tracks running, completed, and failed queries
- **QueryStarted event**: Assigns a unique ID to new query executions
- **QueryCompleted event**: Records which query completed
- **QueryFailed event**: Records which query failed
- **QueryCancelled event**: Records which query was cancelled
- **CancelQuery command**: Specifies which running query to cancel
