## Overview

ChartType is a sum type enumerating supported visualization types in the Analytics bounded context.
Each variant maps to both ECharts and Vega-Lite chart types, providing a unified abstraction.

## Variants

| Variant | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Line | Line chart for continuous data trends |
| Bar | Bar chart for categorical comparisons |
| Scatter | Scatter plot for correlation and distribution |
| Pie | Pie chart for proportional data (single series) |
| Heatmap | Heatmap for 2D density visualization |
| Area | Area chart for cumulative trends |
| Histogram | Histogram for frequency distribution |
| Boxplot | Box plot for statistical distribution summary |

## Invariants

- ChartType is exhaustive; all variants must be handled in pattern matching
- Pie charts are restricted to single series data

## Usage

- **ChartConfig**: Specifies the chart type for visualization
- **Chart validation**: Validates that data matches chart type constraints
