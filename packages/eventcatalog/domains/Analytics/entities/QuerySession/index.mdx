## Overview

The QuerySession aggregate manages interactive SQL query execution within the Analytics domain.
Each query session tracks a single SQL statement through its complete lifecycle from submission to completion or failure.

## Decider Pattern

The QuerySession aggregate follows the fmodel-rust Decider pattern.

**Commands handled:**
- `StartQuery`: Initiates query execution with SQL statement
- `CancelQuery`: User-requested cancellation of running query

**Events emitted:**
- `QuerySessionStarted`: Query execution began
- `QuerySessionCompleted`: Query finished successfully with results
- `QuerySessionFailed`: Query terminated with error
- `QuerySessionCancelled`: User cancelled running query

**State transitions:**

```
Idle -> Running (StartQuery)
Running -> Completed (success)
Running -> Failed (error)
Running -> Cancelled (CancelQuery)
```

## Relationships

- **User** (Session): Each query is associated with an authenticated user
- **Dataset**: Queries reference one or more datasets (implicit via SQL)
- **Dashboard** (Workspace): Chart definitions may reference QuerySession results
- **QuerySessionService**: QuerySession is managed by QuerySessionService

## Execution Model

Queries execute against DuckDB via async-duckdb with streaming results.
Long-running queries support cancellation through the `CancelQuery` command.
Results are cached in moka with TTL-based eviction.

## Audit Trail

The QuerySession provides audit capabilities by recording:
- Who executed the query (userId)
- What was executed (sqlStatement)
- When it ran (startedAt, durationMs)
- Outcome (status, errorDetails)
