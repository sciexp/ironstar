## Overview

CatalogRef is a value object representing a reference to a DuckLake catalog through a URI.
The URI scheme follows the pattern `ducklake:{provider}://{path}` where provider indicates the data source (e.g., `hf` for Hugging Face).

## URI Format

| Component | Example | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Scheme | `ducklake:` | DuckLake protocol identifier |
| Provider | `hf:` | Hugging Face datasets |
| Path | `//datasets/sciexp/fixtures` | Resource path within provider |

Full example: `ducklake:hf://datasets/sciexp/fixtures`

## Invariants

- URI must follow DuckLake URI format conventions
- URI uniqueness determines catalog identity
- Two CatalogRef instances with the same URI are considered equal

## Usage

- **Catalog aggregate**: Tracks the currently active catalog via CatalogActive state
- **CatalogSelected event**: Records which catalog was selected
- **SelectCatalog command**: Specifies which catalog to activate
