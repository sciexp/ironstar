## Overview

CatalogMetadata is a value object representing metadata about a DuckLake catalog, including the inventory of available datasets and freshness timestamp.
This metadata is refreshed periodically to synchronize with upstream catalog changes.

## Invariants

- Datasets list may be empty (for newly selected catalogs before first refresh)
- Last refreshed timestamp must be valid and non-future
- Dataset list order is stable across refreshes
- Dataset uniqueness determined by name within the catalog

## Usage

- **Catalog aggregate**: Stores metadata in CatalogActive state
- **CatalogMetadataRefreshed event**: Records updated metadata
- **CatalogSelected event**: Initializes with empty dataset list
- **Analytics read model**: Projects catalog metadata for queries
