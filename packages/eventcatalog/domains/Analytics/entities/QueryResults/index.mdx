## Overview

QueryResults is a value object representing metadata about a successful query execution.
This is a simplified representation for the event sourcing specification; production implementations include actual row data via separate caching.

## Invariants

- Row count must be non-negative
- Column names list must be non-empty for non-zero row counts
- Column names must be unique within a result set
- Column name order matches the column order in the result set

## Usage

- **QueryCompleted event**: Records result metadata when query succeeds
- **QuerySession aggregate**: Stores results in Completed state
- **Analytics read model**: Tracks completed query results for history
