## Overview

ChartConfig is a value object representing a complete chart specification combining chart type with rendering options.
This configuration is produced by Analytics and consumed by Workspace for visualization rendering.

The configuration supports both ECharts and Vega-Lite libraries with a unified abstraction layer.

## Invariants

- Chart type must be a valid ChartType variant
- Chart options must be well-formed according to ChartOptions structure
- Chart configuration must be serializable for SSE transmission

## Usage

- **StartQuery command**: Optionally specifies chart configuration
- **QueryStarted event**: Records chart configuration when provided
- **Workspace Dashboard**: Consumes chart configuration to render visualizations
