## Overview

GridPosition is a value object representing coordinates within a dashboard's grid layout system.
Charts are positioned using row and column indices, enabling responsive grid-based layouts.

## Invariants

- Row and column values must be non-negative (0-indexed grid)
- Chart placements should not overlap within a tab
- Overlap detection: two charts overlap if their grid rectangles intersect

## Usage

- **ChartPlacement**: Contains GridPosition for chart positioning
- **Dashboard aggregate**: Uses GridPosition in placements list
- **Layout validation**: Checks for overlapping chart positions
