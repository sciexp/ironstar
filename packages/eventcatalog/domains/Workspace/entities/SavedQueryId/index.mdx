## Overview

SavedQueryId is a value object representing a unique identifier for a saved query.
Query names are unique per user, enforced at boundary via aggregate ID pattern like "user_123/my-query-name".

## Invariants

- Generated at boundary layer during query save
- Immutable after creation
- Per-user uniqueness enforced via aggregate ID construction

## Usage

- **SavedQuery aggregate**: Primary identifier for saved query lifecycle
- **QuerySaved event**: Records the assigned SavedQueryId
- **Dashboard charts**: Reference SavedQueryId as data source
