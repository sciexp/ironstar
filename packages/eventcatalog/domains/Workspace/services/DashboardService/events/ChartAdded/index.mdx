## Description

This event is emitted when a user adds a chart visualization to an existing dashboard.
The event carries a `ChartPlacement` record containing the chart ID, reference to the ChartDefinition, grid position, size, and optional tab assignment.

The `ChartPlacement` record structure is:
- `chartId`: Unique identifier for this chart placement
- `chartDefRef`: Reference to the ChartDefinition from Analytics context (contains `refId` and optional `chartTypeHint`)
- `position`: Grid position as a record with `row` and `col` (0-indexed)
- `size`: Grid size as a record with `width` and `height` (in grid units)
- `tabId`: Optional tab ID if chart is placed within a specific tab

## Business Rules

- Chart definition reference must point to a valid ChartDefinition from Analytics
- Grid position must be valid (non-negative row and column)
- Grid size must be positive (width and height >= 1)
- Chart can be placed on the default view or within a specific tab
- If tabId is specified, it must reference an existing tab in the dashboard

## Given-When-Then

Given a dashboard exists and chart definitions from prior queries are available, When the Data Analyst adds a chart with placement information (position, size, and optional tab), Then ChartAdded is recorded with the complete ChartPlacement record.
