## Responsibilities

- Create new workspaces with owner and visibility settings
- Rename workspaces
- Change workspace visibility (Public/Private)
- Maintain workspace identity immutability after creation

## Aggregate: Workspace

The Workspace aggregate serves as the organizational container for dashboards, saved queries, and preferences.
It manages workspace identity, naming, ownership, and visibility settings.

### Key Value Objects

- **WorkspaceId**: Unique identifier for a workspace (immutable after creation)
- **WorkspaceName**: User-facing display name
- **Visibility**: Access control setting (Public or Private)
- **UserId**: Reference to owner from SharedKernel

### Invariants

- WorkspaceId is immutable after creation
- OwnerId references a valid UserId from SharedKernel
- Visibility is always a valid Visibility value (Public or Private)

## Visibility Semantics

- **Public**: Visible to all authenticated users
- **Private**: Visible only to owner (and explicitly shared users in future)
