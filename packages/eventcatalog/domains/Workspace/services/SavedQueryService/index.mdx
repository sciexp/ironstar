## Responsibilities

- Save new queries with name, SQL, and dataset reference
- Rename, update SQL, or change dataset reference
- Delete saved queries

## Workspace Context

SavedQuery operations occur within a Workspace context.
All saved queries belong to exactly one Workspace, referenced via `workspaceId`.

## Aggregate: SavedQuery

One aggregate instance per saved query (keyed by workspace_id/user_id/query_name).

### State Machine

```
NoQuery → QueryExists(id, name, sql, datasetRef)
    ↑___________________________|  (delete)
```

### Key Value Objects

- **SavedQueryId**: Unique query identifier
- **WorkspaceId**: Reference to containing Workspace
- **DatasetRef**: URI reference to dataset (hf://, s3://, etc.)

### Invariants

- Query names must be non-empty
- SQL must be non-empty
- Names are unique per user (enforced by aggregate ID)
