## Overview

The Workspace bounded context provides a two-tier configuration hierarchy: Workspace aggregates serve as containers for dashboards, saved queries, and workspace-scoped preferences, while UserPreferences stores user-scoped settings that apply across all workspaces.

## Strategic Classification

**Supporting Domain**: Enhances user experience by providing persistent workspace and user state.

## Key Aggregates

- **Workspace**: Primary aggregate root containing dashboards, queries, and workspace preferences
- **Dashboard**: Layout configuration with chart placements and tabs (contained by Workspace)
- **SavedQuery**: Named, reusable SQL queries with dataset references (contained by Workspace)
- **WorkspacePreferences**: Workspace-scoped settings like default catalog and layout defaults
- **UserPreferences**: User-scoped settings (theme, locale, UI state) applied across workspaces

## Containment Hierarchy

```
Workspace (aggregate root)
├── Dashboard (child aggregate)
├── SavedQuery (child aggregate)
└── WorkspacePreferences (child aggregate)

UserPreferences (separate aggregate, user-scoped)
```

## Integration Points

- Upstream: Consumes ChartDefinition references from Analytics
- Upstream: Consumes UserId from Session via Shared Kernel
