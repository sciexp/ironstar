Welcome to the Ironstar event-driven architecture documentation.

Browse the catalog using the navigation to explore:

- **Domains**: Bounded contexts representing business capabilities
- **Services**: Components that produce and consume events
- **Events**: Messages that flow between services
- **Flows**: End-to-end process visualizations

## Status

This catalog is under active development. Content will be populated from Event Modeling artifacts.
