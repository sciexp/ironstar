## Overview

This flow documents the dashboard management operations for organizing and visualizing query results.
Dashboards provide a persistent workspace for charts and visualizations derived from saved queries.

## Dashboard creation

Users create dashboards to organize related visualizations.
A dashboard starts empty and is populated with charts over time.

The DashboardCreated event captures the dashboard identifier, owner, and initial metadata.

## Chart management

Charts are added to dashboards to visualize query results.
Each chart references a saved query or inline SQL and a chart configuration (type, axes, styling).

Charts can be removed when no longer needed.
The DashboardChartRemoved event enables audit trailing of dashboard evolution.

## Tab organization

Tabs provide logical grouping within dashboards.
Large dashboards benefit from organizing related charts into tabs.

Charts can be moved between tabs using the DashboardChartMovedToTab event.
Tab order and naming are configurable.

## Chart types

The platform supports common chart types via ECharts integration.

*Line charts* for time series and trend visualization.

*Bar charts* for categorical comparisons.

*Scatter plots* for correlation analysis.

*Pie charts* for proportion visualization.

*Tables* for detailed data inspection.

Additional chart types are extensible through the ds-echarts web component.

## Layout persistence

Dashboard layout (chart positions, sizes, tab order) is persisted and restored on subsequent visits.
Layout changes emit events for collaborative editing scenarios.

## Sharing and access

Dashboards may be private (owner only) or shared with team members.
Access control is managed through user preferences and session context.
