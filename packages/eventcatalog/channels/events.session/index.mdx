## Overview

This channel carries all session lifecycle events using Zenoh's key expression filtering.
Subscribers can filter to specific event types or receive all session events.

## Key expression patterns

The channel uses hierarchical key expressions for flexible subscription.

`events/session/**` subscribes to all session events.

`events/session/created` subscribes only to session creation events.

`events/session/refreshed` subscribes only to session refresh events.

`events/session/invalidated` subscribes only to session invalidation events.

`events/session/expired` subscribes only to session expiration events.

## Event types carried

This channel carries the following events from the SessionService.

*SessionCreated* is published when a new authenticated session is established after OAuth callback.

*SessionRefreshed* is published when an active session's TTL is extended due to user activity.

*SessionInvalidated* is published when a user explicitly logs out.

*SessionExpired* is published when a session's TTL elapses without refresh.

## Subscriber patterns

Session events typically interest the following consumers.

*Analytics projections* track active user counts and session durations.

*Audit logging* records all session lifecycle changes for compliance.

*Real-time dashboard* displays current active session metrics.

## Zenoh configuration

In embedded mode, Zenoh operates in-process without network overhead.
Session events are distributed to all in-process subscribers.

For multi-node deployments, configure Zenoh peer mode to distribute events across nodes.
