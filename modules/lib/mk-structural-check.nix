# mkStructuralCheck: runCommand JSON-diff helper for asserting that a
# nix value (typically `attrNames` of some attrset, or a sorted list of
# strings) matches a literal expectation.
#
# Inputs and outputs are JSON-serialized at outer eval time and embedded
# as `passAsFile` env vars, so the derivation's input-address closure
# scopes to "did the JSON change?" rather than "did any tracked file in
# the repo change?". This is the architectural payoff over nix-unit for
# structural assertions: cache invalidation tracks the assertion target,
# not `inputs.self`.
#
# Failure mode emits a unified diff, which is far more readable than
# nix-unit's `expr != expected` dump for set-equality failures.
#
# Ported verbatim from vanixiets commit 3fd31c0fb
# (modules/lib/mk-structural-check.nix).
