    # git-remote is registered as a yaml-only config key in beads 0.56.1
    # but has no consumer in production code yet. Setting it here for
    # forward compatibility with the planned bootstrap-from-git-remote flow.

dolt:
    # Issue mutations (create/update/close) always auto-commit to dolt
    # unconditionally via inline DOLT_COMMIT in the storage layer,
    # regardless of this setting. This setting controls whether residual
    # working set changes (tip metadata, etc.) get committed after each
    # command. Required for clean bd dolt pull — off leaves uncommitted
    # state that blocks merges. Server mode defaults to off; on is
    # preferred when using dolt remotes for multi-clone sync.
    auto-commit: "on"
